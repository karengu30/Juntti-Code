#Quick Note for Karen,

#When we use the docker the first line into the terminal is such:

docker run --privileged --name cam -ti alexellis2/streaming:07-05-2018 xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

#Where xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx is the youtube stream key found in our raspi database.

#To remove the stream, usually we just hit ctrl-c to interrupt, and then the following:

docker rm -f cam
